# 4-Digit-Display-for-Dimmer-Switch
Need Help displaying 0-100% on 4 Digit Display when using a rotary angle sensor to adjust the dimmness of a red LED. Right now the display shows 4095, instead of 100 when the light is at its maximum. When the light is off it displays 0 like it should. I am new to coding and am not sure what to do.
